I’m a bilingual Arabic–English Voice-Over Artist delivering expressive, high-quality recordings for commercials, narration, dubbing, and IVR.
I combine clear delivery, emotional depth, and professional audio production to give every script a unique signature sound that elevates the brand.

With strong communication, reliable turnaround, and the ability to interpret both creative and corporate scripts, I make the recording process smooth and enjoyable — helping clients achieve the message and tone they envision.

If you’re looking for a versatile female voice with a polished and memorable presence, I’d be happy to bring your project to life.
