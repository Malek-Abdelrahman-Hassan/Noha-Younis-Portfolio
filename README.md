# Noha Younis — Voice Over Portfolio

A modern, responsive portfolio website for voice over artist **Noha Younis**, featuring interactive demo players and a contact/quote form UI.

## Project structure

- `index.html` — main site
- `styles.css` — styling (teal & gold theme)
- `script.js` — audio players, animations, form UX
- `Voice/` — voice samples (MP3 + WAV)

## Run locally

Just open `index.html` in your browser.

> Tip: If your browser blocks local audio playback in some cases, run a local server.

### Quick local server (PowerShell)

```powershell
python -m http.server 5500
```

Then open `http://localhost:5500`.

## Notes

- The **Request a Quote** form is currently a front-end demo (it shows a success message). It does **not** save submissions anywhere yet.
